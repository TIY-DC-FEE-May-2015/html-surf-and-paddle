				Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.

				Most stunning of all was Noll's reaction. He was a legend in the sport, a larger-than-life character who had ridden giant waves for years, and he suddenly retired at the age of 31. That was his swan song. For those devoted to the sport and its lifelong benefits, it was difficult to fathom how Noll could simply
				<a href="#">walk away.</a>

				<blockquote class="style"> WOAH, THAT'S RADICAL!</blockquote>

				And yet, big-wave surfing is the essence of his being. He's not in the sport to show off or impress anyone. He's really good at it, and when confronted with the ultimate test - a veritable <a href="#">(oceanic) avalanche.</a> heading his way, with an opportunity to whip his board around and ride that thing - he will go.
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph2">
				You just can't find that type of thrill at the dry cleaners. Even an everyday
				surf session, the kind many would cherish for weeks, leaves Dollar unfulfilled. His life seems perfectly in order: college degree (Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo), steady job (Northern California rep for Reef footwear), wonderful family. But he has reached the heights of big-wave experience, and he finds the aftermath a disturbing mix of pride and exasperation.
